# devops-assignment
Assignment for creating  a complete CI/CD infrastructure pipeline on AWS using Terraform, Kubernetes, ArgoCD.

This repository contains the code and configuration I used to build a complete CI/CD setup on AWS using Terraform, EKS, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD.
The setup provisions an EKS cluster, deploys an NGINX application, and uses ArgoCD for GitOps based continuous delivery.
This application is exposed through an Ingress controller with a DNS hostname(http://mydemonginx.nosky.io/).
